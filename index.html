    <p class="p"> Studio Cat is the record label created by musicians and collaborators Raphael Hendrick-Baker and Jasper Piermarini for their own releases. Starting with their classical project Gnomatix, and plans to release a vocal album, they hope to extend it to other artists in the future.</p>
    <p class="p" id="anchor">If you have music you want released, but can't get signed with another label or don't know how to release it yourself, contact us, and we will do all of the work of getting your music out into the world for you. We can even produce your music for you if you need! If you have unheard music, we want to make it heard.</p>

    <p class="p"id="GnomatixDescription">Gnomatix entered the classical crossover genre with the release of their first album “Shades” in the fall of 2020.  A few months later, they released a single and their solo piano album "Phases" will be released on July 30, 2021. They wrote music to accompany a video celebrating their school at a fundraising event, and their music has been streamed hundreds of times on Spotify. Expect more releases from Gnomatix in the future.</p>
